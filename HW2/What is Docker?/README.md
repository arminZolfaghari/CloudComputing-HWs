===============

This is an Intro to Docker slide deck built using [Reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js).

The contents of the the slides have been stol..., umm, *liberally borrowed* 
from [pointful](http://pointful.github.io/docker-intro/) materials.

Thanks to everyone at Docker, Inc for all the great work they are doing!
